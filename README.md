# Train a Smart Cab to Drive

## Project name : Train a Smart Cab to Drive
## Duration : Jan 2018 – Feb 2018

## Objective

   #### ● Implement a Basic Driving Agent
   #### ● Define the Environment States
   #### ● Implement Q-Learning to find an optimal action-selection policy in a simulated driving environment


## Project description :
#### ● The goal of the project was to apply reinforcement learning techniques for a self-driving agent in a simplified world to aid it in effectively reaching its destinations in the allotted time.

#### ●  The project involved modeling a complex control problem in terms of limited available inputs and designing a scheme to automatically learn an optimal driving strategy based on rewards and penalties


## This project contains 3 files:

   #### ● The agent.py Python file with all code implemented as required in the instructed tasks.
   #### ● The /logs/ folder which should contain five log files that were produced from your simulation and used in the analysis.
   #### ● The smartcab.ipynb notebook file have all code


## Software and Libraries

## This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

   #### ● Python 2.7
   #### ● NumPy
   #### ● pandas
   #### ● scikit-learn (v0.17)
   #### ● matplotlib
   #### ● PyGame
   #### ● Jupyter Notebook
